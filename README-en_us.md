# Development Guide

## How to Build

Execute the command below in the project root directory:

```
* Windows *
gradlew build

* Linux / Unix *
./gradlew build
```

Then you can find the archives in the directory `build/libs`.

**NOTICE: If you meet some compilation errors, You can try [Importing CuckooLib Repository](#working-with-cuckoolib). It
may solve your problems.**

## Working with CuckooLib

[CuckooLib](https://github.com/zi-jing/CuckooLib) is a dependency library of the EOC project. It includes plenty of
reusable code which is used by Cuckoo Dev Team.

If you want to debug EOC more easily, or you want to debug CuckooLib with EOC, you can clone
the [CuckooLib repository](https://github.com/zi-jing/CuckooLib), then create the file `gradle.properties` in the EOC
project's root directory, add the folllowing contents:

```properties
CuckooLibIncludeBuildPath=../CuckooLib
```

In the above code, key `CuckooLibIncludeBuildPath` refers to the CuckooLib project's root path.

Save the files, refresh the Gradle project in your IDE, then the CuckooLib project will be imported.
